.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.Vb 7
\&    A voting based start site curation algorithm.  The algorithm uses evidence generated
\&    by BER alignments, as well as taking into consideration ribosomal binding sites
\&    (shine delgarno consensus sequence) as well as start site probabilities.  Reads gene
\&    information from gene describing BSML input (such as that output from promote_gene_prediction
\&    or glimmer3) and also evidence (a list of BSML output files from BER alignment run).  
\&username
\&    A start site will be changed according to the following algorithm:
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 19
\&    1. BER Evidence
\&       - All alignments not passing the percent_identity and p_value cutoffs are eliminated
\&       - Any alignment which begins at a start site within the query sequence gets a vote
\&       - A bonus is added if the subject sequence is a characterized protein (characterized_
\&         vote_bonus).
\&       - The start site with the highest number of votes is chosen as new start if the
\&         number of votes is greater than or equal to the min_vote_cutoff.  If there is a 
\&         tie (i.e. two start sites with the same vote count):
\&    2. Ribosomal Binding Site
\&       - The sequence upstream of the start site is searched (20 nucleotides upstream
\&         to 5 nucleotides upstream [coords -20 -> -5 relative to start site] ).
\&       - Lengths of sequences of size sliding_window_size are measured for AG content. If
\&         the AG percentage is greater than or equal to the percent_ag_cutoff, the start
\&         site is considered to have an RBS and is given one vote.
\&    3. Start Site probabilities
\&       - The occurence of all the start sites is counted and the relative frequencies are
\&         calculated.  The relative frequency is added to the vote total.  This will never be
\&         greater than one vote, and therefore will only be useful in deciding ties at this 
\&         point.
.Ve
.SH "INPUT"
.IX Header "INPUT"
.Vb 9
\&    Input is a gene describing bsml document.  It should contain a Sequence element 
\&    representing the genomic sequence with Feature children representing the genes.
\&    Each gene should have a Feature element of class polypeptide, CDS, gene, transcript,
\&    and exon and their relationships should be described with Feature-groups.  The Sequence
\&    element must also have a Seq-data-import linking to fasta.  Attributes of the Sequence
\&    element that are exptected are:
\&      Sequence[@molecule]
\&      Sequence[@class]
\&      Sequence[@id]
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    Ids for the Feature elements are assumed to be generated by Ergatis::IdGenerator and
\&    in the format proj.feature_type.12345.1 .
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    The BER evidence input is a list of BER bsml files which are generated using the 
\&    ergatis component.  The BSML is formatted as our standard usage for alignment
\&    analyses.
.Ve
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
.Vb 3
\&    The output is a gene describing bsml document.  The version number on the genes and
\&    related features where start site changes have occurred are incremented to indicate 
\&    a new version of the gene.
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    The script can print two sets of bsml files.  The first set includes the all genes
\&    and is representative of the working models for the sequence.  The second set is a 
\&    collection of bsml files which only list the genes which have changed.  The second
\&    set bsml files (only changed features) is optional and will not be printed if the 
\&    --changed_features_bsml option is not used.
