This ontology should remain largely invisible to the casual user</p><p>This ontology is designed to be used by the following groups of people: <dl><dt>OBO curators</dt><dd>each OBO ontology should use relations that are consistent with the relations defined here</dd><dt>Database administrators and developers, and other software developers</dt><dd>This ontology file is a partial computable specification of the core relationships in OBO. (The full semantics can not be specified using the OBO format, please refer to the paper for a full specification).
